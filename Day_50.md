TypeScript Practice
1. Setup TypeScript
    1. TSC (TypeScript Compiler)
    2. TSX (TypeScript Execute)
    3. TS-NODE (TypeScript (The "Virtual" Compilation) (The Legacy Runner))
2. tsconfig.json
    1. files      (Strict way to include files)
    2. Include    (include entire directories by patterns)
    3. Exclude    (ignore  entire directories by patterns)
    4. Extends    (Join another config file)
    5. References (Config sub-projects, Use larger system)
    6. Compiler Options
        1. rootDir (this the starting point of my source code)
        2. outDir (Where to generate JavaScript files)
