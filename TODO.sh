- [ ] "Practice" --> (Students&Courses) Database


04_Correlated_Subqueries.sql: (Advanced!) These are subqueries that "talk" to the outer query. They are powerful but can be slow if not used carefully.
05_EXISTS_vs_IN.sql: A comparison file showing when to use EXISTS for better performance.
Window Functions: Things like ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and PARTITION BY. These are the "secret sauce" for complex reporting.
Security/DCL: A small folder for GRANT, REVOKE, and CREATE USER.
