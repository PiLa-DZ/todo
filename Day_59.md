1. Challenge 1: Goal: Take an object and swap the keys and values.
2. Challenge 2: Goal: auto-generate "Setter" functions.
3. Challenge 3: Goal: Create a type that makes only specific keys required, while leaving the rest of the object exactly as it was.
4. Challenge 4: Goal: Keeps the id property exactly as it is (Required). Makes every other property in the object optional (?).
